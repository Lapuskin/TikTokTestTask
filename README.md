# TikTokTestTask
Here is the code for the test task for Python Developer. Below is the task itself.
--------------
Develop a Python pipeline to fetch, process, and report on 100 trending TikTok videos from your
current location. The task involves downloading videos without watermarks, modifying them, and
generating a summary report.

Steps:
1. Fetch Trending TikTok Videos:
○ Retrieve 100 trending TikTok videos for your specified location.
○ Ensure you are using an appropriate method to get the trending videos list (e.g.,
using an API or web scraping).
2. Download Videos Without Watermarks:
○ For each video URL obtained, download the video file ensuring no watermarks are
present.
3. Modify the Videos:
○ Modify each downloaded video by:
■ Reducing the speed to 90%.
■ Reducing the resolution to 90%.
■ Replacing the audio track with the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick
Astley.
4. Generate a Report:
○ Create a short report summarizing the actions performed.
○ The report should include:
■ Number of videos processed.
■ Time taken for the entire process.
■ Any issues encountered and how they were resolved.
○ Format the report in a readable manner, possibly as a PDF or Markdown file.
Deliverables:
● A Python script implementing the entire pipeline.
● The final report file summarizing the work done.
